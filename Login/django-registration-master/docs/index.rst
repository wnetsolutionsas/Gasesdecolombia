django-registration |version|
=============================

``django-registration`` is a simple, extensible application providing
user registration functionality for `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_-powered Web sites.

Although nearly all aspects of the registration process are
customizable, out-of-the-box support is provided for two common use
cases:

* Two-phase registration, consisting of initial signup followed by a
  confirmation email with instructions for activating the new account.

* One-phase registration, where a user signs up and is immediately
  active and logged in.

To get up and running quickly, consult :ref:`the quick start guide
<quickstart>`, which describes the steps necessary to configure
``django-registration`` for the built-in workflows. For more detailed
information, including how to customize the registration process (and
support for alternate registration systems), read through the
documentation listed below.
